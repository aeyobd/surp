Next, the contribution from CCSNe is added to the ISM, causing an increase in \\[O/Fe\\] and a increase in metalicity. Next, stars formed during the burst begin to also explode as SNIa, resulting in a dropping \\[O/Fe\\] and further increasing \\[Fe/H\\] as the model aproaches its final chemical equilibrium. \\[Fe/H\\] is overshot slightly because more SNIa explode from the burst than gas is added resulting in a temporary Fe enrichment that reduces over time.\n",

Since the burst is caused by an increased gas infall, at the begining of the burst at 11.2 Gyr, the \\[O/H\\] ratio begins to drop from its equilibrium value. \\[C/O\\] also begins to drop since while the burst increased star formation, the additional contributions from AGB stars are not significant yet. As the gas infall slows, the \\[O/H\\] ratio starts to increase again and the delayed contribution from AGB stars drives up the \\[C/O\\] ratio. Finally, the system evolves to a similar equilibrium as the non-starburst case.\n",

The major difference is that \\[O/H\\] and especially \\[C/O\\] overshoot equilibrium more visibaly resulting in an additional loop. The overshoot happens because the increased enrichment during the starburst is deposited into a declining gas supply, resulting in super-equilibrium abundances. The equilibrium is then restored as the gas supply returns to its pre-burst exponential decline with less star formation. The carbon super-equilibrium abundances occur at a slightly later time than with oxygen because of the delayed AGB contribution, causing \\[C/O\\] to increase and then decrease.\n",
