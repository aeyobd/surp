    "## Overview of AGB Evolution\n",
    "An Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star is a type of low mass star (about 0.8-8$M_\\odot$) towards the end of its lifetime. \n",
    "Low and intermediate mass stars (less than 8-10 $M_\\odot$), begin on the main sequence fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. An inert helium core builds up, and the stars begin to ascend the red giant branch (RGB) as they shift to shell hydrogen burning. During the RGB phase, the convective envelope may reach into the core bringing up H burning products during the first dredge up. Lower stars will ignite helium burning in a degenerate core, with core mass roughly independent of initial mass, but larger stars will ignite helium in the center. These stars procede to the core Helium burning phase (with the high intermediate mass stars $8<M<10$ also proceeding to burn C) until they build up an inert core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AGB phase happens after core helium burning ends. The star expands again and the surface cools. Inside the star, there is a inert C/O core of Helium burning products, a Helium burning shell outside the core, a H burning shell, and a convective envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an AGB star consists of two thin nuclear-burning shells, it is thermally unstable, leading to thermal pulsations (TP) during the TP-AGB phase. During a TP, the star contracts too much initiation a helium flash which forces the star to expand (about once every 1000 years or so). The TP eventually drive away the outer layers of the envalope, polluting the interstellar medium (ISM) with nuclear fusion products, leaving behind the core which now becomes a white dwarf. \n",
    "\n",
    "TDU may happen during pusations of a TPAGB star, the convective layer does not contract as quickly as the rest of the layer and reaches into the C/O core of the star, bringing up C to the outer convective layers. Because convection is still poorly understood, models disagree in the frequency and size of TDU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In between each pulse, there may also be Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) where the temperature of the convective envelope exceedes about 50MK, causing the CNO cycle to initiate. Since the slowest reaction in the CNO cycle is the ____________, the first order effect of the CNO cycle is to convert Carbon into Nitrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence and amount of HBB and TDU are critical for determining the production of Carbon and Nitrogen since these are the main processes which either add or remove Carbon. TDU primarily increases the total amount of CNO in the star, whereas HBB changes the ratios of CNO but without significantly changing to total abundance."
