Highly magnified galaxy. Subaru & HST imaging. Magellan/FIRE + GMOS + others for spectra...

No species has ionization corrections. The study says that given 
the log u value, the ionization corrections should be minimal.

For 12+log(O/H), I use their reported mean value.
The study uses a variety of methods (Te-direct, R23 method with many calibrations)
.
For C/O I use their 1909/1666 line ratio abundance.
