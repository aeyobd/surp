X-SHOOTER lynman alpha survey for redshift z=2 (XLS-z2). 
35 galaxies in total but 20 in the stacked spectrum.

I use their Te eps_o measurement for consistency, however they do
calculate R23, O32 Ne3O2 methods. Note the direct Te method
is by far the lowest and the highest eps_o measurement is 8.39.
Uses perez-montero+amorin's method to derive log c/o
