RL for extragalactic H II regions
ISIS spectrograph on Herschel telescope

No He II => O IV is minimal so oxygen abundance is just OII + OIII.
C is derived from CII 4267 recombination line + ICs near unity from garnett ++.
Values without uncertanties are very low signal to noise. All C derived values assume t^2 value > 0. 
Contains also N, S, Ar abundances.
