notes = """sample of BCG under HST. C for seven galaxies referenced in berg+19
I average the measurements of I Zw 18 NW and SE regions, and for N5253 I average the two HII regions and the UV-1 region. The valueas are statistically consistent for each region.
As such C is derived from the 1906, 1909 lines. 
O++ for C/O is derived from 5007.
