Note that some studies predict a large net loss of carbon in CCSN especially at high Z (e.g. CL04).\n",

    "In AGB stars, there are two processes which change carbon yields, third dredge up (TDU) and hot bottom burning (HBB).\n",
    "\n",
    "TDU happens when during a pusation of a TPAGB star, the convective layer does not contract as quickly as the rest of the layer and reaches into the C/O core of the star, bringing up C to the outer convective layers. Because convection is still poorly understood, models disagree in the frequency and size of TDU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNO cycle is a major Carbon sink, since the $^{14}$N proton capture is the slowest reaction, to first order, the CNO cycle converts Carbon into Nitrogen. During HBB, Carbon is converted into Nitrogen when the Carbon brought up from TDU passes through the H burning shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major differences between the models appears to be the normilization of the carbon yields. This seems to be because the physics of the triple alpha process is relatively well understood but the exact reaction rates are poorly constrained.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the net mass yield over time, each model has the same qualitative shape, where the initial plateu is definied by what fraction CCSNE provide of the total carbon yield, since different models vary most remarkably on the amount of carbon they produce for each star. Next, the most massive AGB stars eject their envalopes, and all the models predict a negative net yield from 7$M_\\odot$ to about 4-5$M_\\odot$. Next, the lower mass AGB stars which produce most of the carbon yield die causing the increase in carbon yield which slows down as very low mass AGB stars produce less net carbon yield.\n",
