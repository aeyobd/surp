% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
% context
C is an important element across astronomy. However, its origin remains poorly understood. 
% 
As stellar yields are highly uncertain, we aim to constrain the stellar yields of C through multi-zone Galactic chemical evolution models. 
% results
We use \apogee\ subgiants to constrain the model. 
% 
We find that \caafe\ is an emirical estimate of the delayed C sources, enabling us to estimate that \agb\ stars and \cc\ produce about 20\% and 80\% of C, respectively.  
The \caah\ trend instead represents the equilibrium abundances of C and Mg. 
We use the \caah\ trend to estimate the CCSNe C/Mg yield, determining that  $\Ycc/\Yoc = EQUATION$ when including \agb\ C. 
% misc
Our models are relatively independent of uniform scaling of yields and outflows, alternate \sfh{}s. 
However, the stars which contribute to \agb\ C production and the \ia\ delay time distribution of Fe contribute uncertainties to our conclusions. 
% gas phase
While reliable gas-phase and low-metallicity measurments of C are challenging, we find that our model and a singlezone model with our recommended yields replicate the broad trends of \caah across different environments and metallicities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

Carbon is a distinctive and well-studied element in astronomy. 
Formed in the cores of stars during He fusion, C is the lightest directly synthesized element after He, one of the only light elements formed in low-mass stars, and one the most abundant metals\footnotemark{}. % \citep[e.g.][]{jennifer19, KL14}
C structurally changes the environments it pollutes, modifying stellar evolution, facilitating the formation of stars and planets, and forming the basis of earthly life.
% C/N as age indicator?
As such, understanding the origin of C has wide ranging implications. 
While we know both lower-intermediate-mass and high-mass stars produce C, the relative importance of each process is still unknown.

\footnotetext{Astronomers are not chemists. By metallicity, we mean the (mass) fraction of any element which is not H or He, denoted by $Z$. For the sun, $Z_\odot=0.014$. }


Galactic chemical evolution is a powerful tool in understanding the origin of elements. 
Each enrichment process has distinct chemical signatures and timescales, enabling us to reconstruct chemical histories.
Many previous works have used GCE in attemt to understand C abundances, whether through using theoretical stellar models \citep{DTS78, prantzos+18, chiappini+03} 
or understanding  observation \citep{tinsley79, HEK00, BF06, rybizki+17, berg+19, KKL20}.
(See also review in \citealt{romano22}.)
%
Every study agrees that C is produced by a combination of high-mass and \lims{}, different studies disagree on which process is dominant. 
For example CITES conclude \hms{} dominate wherease CITES conclude \lims{} contribute the majority of C.
C is also generally understood to have strong metalliicity dependent CCSNe enrichment. 


One of the primary uncertainties of GCE models are nucleosynthetic yields. Yield predictions -- the amounts of each chemical element stars produce --
are shaped by poorly understood processes, including mass loss, nuclear reaction rates, rotational mixing, convection, and explodability \citep{romano+10,KL14,ventura+13, LC18, emily+21}.
To better understand where C comes from and how it evolves, our aim is to use a combination of \apogee\ observations and multi-zone models to develop estimates of the required C yields to reproduce galactic trends.
\cite{james+23} examined similar \gce{} models of N (which is closely related to C), finding that trends in N and O\footnotemark{} are explained by the metallicity dependence of N/O yields. \citet{james+23} determine that \agb\ N abundances roughly dependence on metallicity (i.e. $y_{\rm N}/y_{\rm O} \propto Z$). 
Here, we extend their models to C, deriving similar constraints on C/Mg yields. We assess which yield prescriptions reproduce Galactic abundance trends while investigating the impact of \gce{} model assumptions, such as \sfh{} and outflow mass loading.

 
\footnotetext{e.g. \citet{HEK00,PVT10,berg+12, berg+20, skillman+20, izotov+12, james2+15, dopita+16}.} 
We know, from observations of MW stars and extragalactic gas measurments, that C/O traces a banana shape in O/H (see \ref{fig:gas_phase}). 
% \cite[e.g.][]{fabbian+09, nissen+14, lambert81, laird85, lambert86}. 
At very low metallicities, C/O decreases with increasing metallicity, from observations of halo stars and damped Lyman-alpha systems\footnotemark{} \citep{nissen+14, cooke+17, fabbian+09}. 
\footnotetext{DLAs; high redshift clouds of gas observed as absorption lines in yet higher redshift quasars}
%
However, the trend reverses around $[{\rm O/H}]\approx-1$\footnotemark{}. 
C/O instead increases with increasing metallicity in observations of HII regions and Milky Way stars (\citealt{berg+19}; see discussion in section \ref{sec:gas}).


\footnotetext{In this paper, we use the standard notation for chemical abundances. $[A/B] = \log_{10}\left(A/B\right) - \log_{10}\left(A_{\sun}/B_{\sun}\right)$, i.e. $[A/B]$ is the logarithm of the ratio between A and B, scaled such that $[A/B]=0$ for the sun. Solar abundances are as measured in \citet{asplund+09}.}


However, observations of C are not without challenges. 
As stars ascend the red giant branch (RGB) at the end of H core burning, C abundances are changed by \textit{first dredge up}\footnotemark{}. This has the benefit of allowing C/N to be used as an age indicator in RGB stars \citep{MG15, martig16, hasselquist19, vincenzo+21}, but evolved stars are no longer as useful for determining birth abundances. Works such as \citet{vincenzo+21} attempt to correct for these changes but this requires MESA stellar modeling. 
In optical spectroscopy, C lines are relatively faint, and surveys such as GALAH struggle against low detection rates, potentially biasing sample measurments. While \apogee\ includes more reliable C$_2$ lines, there is an additional risk of systematics because .....
In the gas phase, HII regions are our best window into C abundances in our galaxy and extragalactic regions including dwarf. 
Unfortunantly, C lacks strong optical emission lines. Approaches use either recombination lines or ... in the ultraviolet, but these methods disagree, making gas-phase abundances a limited metric for GCE models of C.


    As our primary observational constraint, we use a sample of subgiant stars from the \apogee{} \citep{apogee17}. selected by the criteria in Roberts et al. (2023, in prep; see Appendix \ref{sec:jack}).
According to stellar evolution theory and observations \citep{gilroy89, korn+07, lind+08, souto+18, souto19}, these stars have not yet experienced first dredge up (FDU) but have well-mixed envelopes. So, subgiant surface abundances should represent their birth composition. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:subgiants} shows the subgiant sample plotted in \caah\ and \caafe{}. [C/Mg] increases with metallicity, and [C/Mg] decreases with [Mg/Fe] at fixed [Mg/H]. 
Using these trends, we will develop a model of the enrichment sources and evolution of C.

\citet{james+23} compare their model against the \cite{vincenzo+21} sample of \apogee{} \citep{apogee17} RGB stars. \citet{vincenzo+21} use \textsc{mesa} stellar evolution models \citep{mesa} to correct for the effects of first dredge up. 
We instead use the \citetjack~sample of \apogee{} subgiants. Subgiant stars have not undergone first dredge up but have well-mixed atmospheres, so their atmospheric C and N abundances are still reflective of their birth abundances and do not need mixing corrections. We only compare the models to the low-$\alpha$ sequence unless otherwise specified.  The selection criteria and differences between the samples are described in more detail in Appendix \ref{sec:jack}.


\footnotetext{First dredge up (FDU) is when material from CNO processed core is mixed with the (convective) stellar envelop during the ascent onto the RGB. As a result, C is decreased and N is increased depending on the strength of this process and the envelop mass.}

On the bottom, we colour-code stars according to their [Mg/H] abundance.} \label{fig:subgiants}

\section{Nucleosynthesis}

Yields -- the amounts of each chemical element stars synthesise -- are central to studies of galactic chemical evolution (GCE). 
In this section, we discuss the yield choices of our model and literature models for C yields. 
We focus on three nucleosynthetic pathways: asymptotic giant branch (\agb{}) stars, core collapse supernovae (\cc{}), and type Ia supernovae (\ia{}).
C is produced in both \agb{} and \cc{} stars.
We also use Mg and Fe as tracers of \cc{} and \ia{} enrichment respectively. 
O and Mg are produced almost entirely from \cc\ with metallicity-independent yields. In contrast Fe is produced in similar amounts by \cc\ and \ia.

After a single stellar population (SSP)\footnotemark{} forms, \cc{} are the first chemical enrichers. \cc{} explode within $\lesssim 40$\,Myr, providing light elements (C, O, and Mg) and heavier elements (Fe and beyond). Next, low-mass stars begin to reach the end of their lives. By shedding their outer layers, \agb{} stars are important sources of C, N, and neutron capture elements.  Finally, white dwarfs explode in \ia{}, releasing Fe and other iron-peak elements.

\footnotetext{SSP: Single stellar population. Technical name for a group of stars born in the same conditions at the same time, i.e. an open cluster.}


To quantify yields, we define the stellar yield to be the fraction of a stars initial mass which is newly synthesized and released as a given element. 
For an element $X$ and star with mass $M$, the net-fractional stellar yield $\y$ is 
\begin{equation}
\y_{X} =  \Delta Z_X \frac{M_{\rm ejected}}{M_{\rm birth}}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm ejected}$ and $M_{\rm birth}$  are the total ejected mass and the birth mass of the star, and $\Delta Z_X$ is the change in mass fraction of abundance X from birth to ejected. For example, if a 1\,\Mo\ star has $\y_{\C} = 10^{-3}$, then the star will add $10^{-3}\,\Mo$ of new C to the interstellar medium. 
Although per-star yields are necessary to compute \agb{} star enrichment rates in \gce{}  models, \imf-averaged yields are useful in interpreting their predictions. 
Given the fractional yield $\y(M, Z)$ as a function of initial stellar mass $M$ and metallicity $Z$, the \imf-averaged yield is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:imf-yield}
    y_{\rm X}(Z,t) = 
    \frac{
    \int_{M_{\rm min}(t)}^{M_{\rm max}} 
    \y_{\rm X}(M, Z)
    \frac{dN}{dM}\ M\ dM
}
{
    \int \frac{dN}{dM}\ M\ dM
}
\end{equation}
where ${dN}/{dM}$ is the \imf, $M_{\rm max}=100\,\Mo$ is the maximum stellar mass, and $M_{\rm min}(t)$ is the mass of stars with lifetime $t$.\footnotemark{}
We use $t=10\,$Gyr for total yields when $t$ is not used.
To calculate the \imf-averaged net yields, we use the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution code (\VICE\footnotemark{}). 

We adapt the yield choices of elements besides C from \citet{james+21, james+23}.
Table \ref{tab:fiducial_mod} contains our fiducial yields. 
Following \citet{james+21, james+23}, we also take the \ia{} delay time distribution to be a $t^{-1.1}$ power-law, as suggested by the observations of \citet{maoz+12}.

\subsection{Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars}\label{sec:agb}


An \agb\ star is a low-mass star ($\lesssim 8 M_{\sun}$) during its final phase of evolution.  
In an \agb\ star, two competing processes determine the outcome of C production: \textit{third dredge up} and \textit{hot bottom burning}.  
Third dredge up accompanies thermal pulses in \agb\ stars, where material from the CO core is mixed with the envelope, increasing surface C abundances \citep{KL14}. The C yields of the star are increased as this C-enhanced envelope is released to the interstellar medium. 
Hot bottom burning is the activation of the CNO cycle\footnotemark{}
at the bottom of the convective envelope when $T\gtrsim 50\,{\rm MK}$. Because the $^{14}$N proton capture is the slowest component of the CNO cycle, the CNO cycle converts nearly all \C[12] into $^{14}$N \citep{solar-fusion}.

\footnotetext{
    The CNO cycle is a series of proton-capture reactions with CNO elements resulting in energy generation and the creation of an $\alpha$ particle. $\C[12]({\rm p}, \gamma)

    ^{15}{\rm N}({\rm p}, \alpha)
    \C[12]$. 
There are other less important minor branches of the CNO cycle
 \citep{solar-fusion}.
}


Hot bottom burning and third dredge-up result in mass-dependent C yields. 
Stars less than about??2\,\Mo do not experience third dredge-up. As a result, these stars C abundances are only affected by first dredge-up, resulting in little change to C yields or slight destruction of C.
In 2?? to 4?? \Mo stars, third dredge up becomes important, enriching the outer layers with C, making these stars the most important producers of C. 
In massive, high-metallicity \agb\ stars, both hot bottom burning and third dredge up occur; however, third dredge up is much more efficient, resulting in significant \C[12] destruction.


    In this work, we explore four different sets of \agb\ star yield tables from literature,
    providing necessary well-sampled grids in mass and metallicity. We refer to the yields from the following studies as the following.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cxi: \citet{cristallo+11, cristallo+15}
    \item \kx: \citet{karakas10}
    \item \vxiii: \citet{ventura+13,ventura+14,ventura+18, ventura+20}
    \item \kxvi: \citet{KL16, karakas+18}
\end{enumerate}
In Appendix~\ref{sec:oob_models}, the masses, metallicites, and notable differences between each yield set are briefly described. 
For our models to match observations, we find that need to uniformly amplify these yield tables. We use \cxi\ table, amplified by a factor of 2.9, as the fiducial \agb\ yield.

Fig.~\ref{fig:y_agb} compares the stellar \agb\ C yield for these four models.
Note that the net yields may be negative if a star ejects material with a lower average C abundance than the material the star was formed from.
Most models agree on the qualitative shape of the net fractional \agb\ C yield---% 
stars with masses between about 2--4\,\Mo have the highest fractional C yields. As metallicity increases, the total \agb\ C yield decreases and the mass of the peak increases.

Fig.~\ref{fig:agb-ssp}, on the left, shows the total production of C by \agb\ stars in a \ssp{} at an age $t$, i.e. $\y_{\rm C}(Z_\odot, t)$. 
As the mass range $2\,\Mo\lesssim M \lesssim 4\,\Mo$ is most important for C production, about half of C production occurs before \about{1}\,Gyr, similar to \ia\ Fe. 
\kx{} and \kxvi{} weight C production more heavily towards high-mass \agb\ stars resulting in a faster enrichment delay time, whereas the \cxi\ and \vxiii\ models predict a slightly longer timescale of \about{1}\,Gyr. In any case, little to no C is produced more than 2\,Gyr after a star formation event. In contrast, Fe production continues steadily for 10\,Gyr. 

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:agb-ssp} shows \imf-averaged C yields for each \agb\ model as a function of metallicity.
\vxiii{} differs in that it shows a non-monotonic metallicity dependence. However, this effect is only for models with $\log Z/Z_\odot \lesssim -1$.
Otherwise, models differ only in their yield normalization and metallicity dependence. All models predict yields within a factor of \about{2} for fixed metallicity.
For example, the three models \cxi, \kx{}, and \kxvi{} predict $y_\text{C}^\text{agb}$ to be between 0.006 and 0.008 at solar metallicity, but \cxi\ has a much shallower metallicity dependence than the \kx{} and \kxvi{} models. \vxiii{} instead predicts a yield \about{0.004}.
    As shown in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:agb-ssp}, with increasing $Z$, C enrichment occurs earlier, and C destruction in low-mass stars leads to a declining C abundance at late times.

\subsection{Core Collapse Supernovae}


Massive stars form $^{12}$C in their cores through the triple--$\alpha$ process. However, only C ejected through supernovae and stellar winds contributes to the yield. 
While there are many stellar models providing predictions of \cc{} yields, the results of these models are highly uncertain due to the many stellar modeling uncertainties. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:y_cc} plots calculations of the \imf-integrated yields, defined with Eq.~\ref{eq:imf-yield} (computed using \VICE's \texttt{vice.yields.ccsne.fractional} function). 
\cc{} models predict a wide range of C yields, spanning almost a factor of ten. 
Both the \citet{NKT13} and \cite{LC18} models show positive metallicity dependence. 
The \cite{LC18} models also include rotation, showing that variations in the rotational velocity of the star can dramatically increase the magnitude and metallicity dependence of $\Ycc$. Rotation induces more mixing allowing the CO core to grow larger. As we will later show, \cc\ C production needs to be strongly metallicity-dependent at $Z/Z_\odot \approx 1$, which is consistent with the \cite{LC18} rapidly rotating models.

Fig.~\ref{fig:y_cc} shows the \cxi{} \agb\ model for comparison on the left. Especially at $Z\approx Z_\odot$, most \cc{} models dominate \agb\ C production. Later, we will also show empirically this is the case.
On the right of Fig.~\ref{fig:y_cc}, we also show the \cc{} [C/Mg] ratio, defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c_mg_cc}
    {\rm [C/Mg]^{CC}} = \log_{10}\left( \frac{\Ycc}{\Yoc}\right) - \log_{10} \left( \frac{Z_{{\rm C},\ \sun }}{Z_{{\rm Mg},\ \sun }} \right).
\end{equation}
If only \cc{} produced C, then ${\rm [C/Mg]^{CC}}$ describes the equilibrium abundance of [C/Mg].
Once again, different \cc\ models span a large range in [C/Mg]. 
we chose to instead parameterize $\Ycc$ to enable agreement with observations, as most \cc\ models fail to achieve near-solar [C/Mg].
Assumptions about the explodability landscape affect C and Mg production. Increasing the fraction of stars that explode increases $\Ycc$, as stars that directly collapse do not contribute to explosive yields \citep{emily+21}. However, C is relatively unaffected by the black-hole landscape, as very massive stars contribute C through enriched winds. Since Mg is formed deeper in the core of \hms, the Mg yield drops much more steeply, so models where few stars explode (S16/W18) have higher [C/Mg].

\cc\ models do not reach [O/Mg] due to overproduction of O or underproduction of Mg, or both \citep{emily+21}. Here, we assume ${\rm [O/Mg]} = 0$, which is not compatible with \cc\ models but is consistent with \apogee{} observations \citep{weinberg+19, weinberg+22}.

Out model predictions of [C/Mg] and [C/H] are identical. There is a slight slope in [O/Mg] with metallicity, so this could add a systematic to our model.

As we focus on constraining relative yields, we neglect O and Mg yield variations in the main text (excluding the uniform scaling of yields and massloading in Section~\ref{sec:outflows}). There is substantial variation in predicted Mg yields. Most models predict relatively flat trends metallicity (even with rotation as in \citealt{LC18}). However, the variation is significant and our adopted $\Yoc$ yield is much higher than most models. This is a known problem (see \citealt{emily+21}). \cc\ models underpredict $[{\rm Mg}/{\rm O}]$, and the reason why is unknown.

\section{The Equilibrium Approximation}\label{sec:equilibrium}

In the presence of metal-poor gas accretion and feedback-driven outflows, galaxies reach an equilibrium abundance in which production of new metals is balanced by losses to new stars and outflows \citep{larson72, dalcanton07, FD08, PS11, lilly13}.
While our galaxy is likely not in perfect equilibrium or described by a single, homogeneous chemical
envirnoment, the equilibrium approximation is nevertheless useful in understanding yields and
metallicity dependence of solar neighborhood stars \citep[e.g.][]{james_dwarf,james+23,WAF17}. 

We assume a simple \textit{one-zone} chemical evolution model \cite[e.g.][]{tinsley80, pagel09, matteucci21}.  Newly produced metals are homogeneously and instantaneously mixed, so spatial dependence is neglected.
We define $M_{X}$ to be the mass of element $X$ in the gas-phase, $\dot{M}_\star$ to be the star formation rate (in $\Mo\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$), and $\eta$ to be the mass loading factor $\eta\equiv\dot{M}_{\rm outflow}/\dot{M}_\star$ (representing the strength of outflows). A \ssp\ returns a fraction $r$ of their birth mass to the interstellar medium, due to ejected stellar envelopes.\footnotemark{} 
Here, we will use $\alpha$ as a representative $\alpha$-element, such as O or Mg. 
Given the \imf-averaged yield $y_\alpha$, the rate of change in the gas-phase mass of $\alpha$ is a simple sum of sources and sinks,
\begin{equation}
    \dot{M}_\alpha =  y_\alpha\,\dot{M}_\star - \dot{M}_{\alpha,\,\text{remnants}} - \dot{M}_{\alpha,\,\text{outflows}}
\end{equation}
where $y_\alpha\,\dot{M}_{\star}$ describes \cc\ enrichment. 
In terms of the return mass fraction of stars $r$, the mass lost to remnants is $Z_\alpha\,\dot{M}_\star\,(1-r)$.  And, the outflows deplete mass at a rate $Z_\alpha \,\dot{M}_\star\,\eta$. (We assume the composition of outflows is the same as the interstellar medium.) Substituting for $\eta$ and $r$,  
\begin{equation}
    \dot{M}_\alpha= y_\alpha\,\dot{M}_\star - (1 + \eta - r)\,Z_\alpha\,\dot{M}_\star.
\end{equation}
Assuming an exponentially declining \sfh{} $\dot{M}_\star \propto e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}$, the equilibrium abundance is derived analytically by setting $\dot{Z}_\alpha=0$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:z_eq}
    Z_\alpha^{\rm eq}(R) = \frac{y_\alpha}{1 + \eta(R) - r - \tau_\star / \tau_{\rm sfh}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\star}$ is the star formation rate. ($\eta$ depends on $R$ to create a metallicity gradient. See also Section \ref{sec:vice} and Eq.~\ref{eq:eta_r}.)
In the special case of constant star formation, $\tau_{\rm sfh}\to\infty$, the denominator simplifies to $1+\eta-r$.

Likewise, for \agb\ stars,%
\footnote{In detail, the \agb\ contribution requires integration over the \sfh\ to account for the finite lifetimes of stars. However, for this exponential \sfh, this effect is minimal, so we simply use $\Ycagb$ for the current \agb\ contribution.}
Eq.~\ref{eq:z_eq} then becomes
\begin{equation}
    Z_{\rm C}^{\rm eq}(R) = \frac{\Ycc + \Ycagb}{1 + \eta(R) - r - \tau_\star / \tau_{\rm sfh}}
\end{equation}
And the equilibrium C/$\alpha$ abundance ratio is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:z_co}
    \frac{Z_{\rm C}^{\rm eq}}{Z_\alpha^{\rm eq}} = \frac{\Ycc + \Ycagb }{y_\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Analogous to \cite{james+23} arguments about N, the trends in abundance ratios are set by yield ratios in these \gce{} models. The effect of other \gce{} parameters (most importantly $\eta$) cancels. As a consequence, yield ratios should establish abundance ratio trends in models which assume a different normalization of element yields and mass-loading (see discussion below).
This argument can also be inverted to infer  yields from abundance ratio trends. To the extent that observed C and $\alpha$ trends reflect the equilibrium abundances in different Galactic regions, we can infer the \cc\ yield given an assumed \agb\ star yield (or vice versa). Inferring $\Ycc$ from $\Ycagb$, 
\begin{equation}
    y_\text{C}^\alpha =  y_\alpha^\text{CC} \frac{Z_\text{C,\,eq}}{Z_{\alpha,\,{\rm eq}}} - \Ycagb
\end{equation}
Rewriting this expression as a relative yield of C and Mg,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:y_c_eq}
    \frac{\Ycc}{y_\alpha} = \left(\frac{Z_{\text{C}}}{Z_{\alpha}}\right)_\odot 10^{[{\rm C}/\alpha]} - \frac{\Ycagb}{y_\alpha}.
\end{equation}

\footnotetext{$r\approx0.4$ for a \citealt{kroupa01} \imf.}


\subsection{Analytic Yield Models}

As we will discuss in Section \ref{sec:outflows}, the normalization of yields and $\eta$ is degenerate. This can be observed in Eq.~\ref{eq:z_co}, where changes in $\eta$ or the scaling of $y_{\rm C}/y_{\rm Mg}$ would not affect equilibrium trends. Furthermore, in Eq.~\ref{eq:z_eq}, an increase in both $y_{\rm Mg}$ and $\eta$ would leave $Z_{\rm Mg}^{\rm eq}$ unchanged. Our models here are unable to distinguish the overall scaling of yields and outflow mass loading. Choosing to keep $y_{\rm C}$ fixed reduces unnecessary free parameters. So, at solar metallicity, we set
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \Yct(\Zo) &= \Ycc + \Ycagb = 0.005 \\
        \left(\frac{\Yct}{\Yoc}\right)_{\Zo} &= 2.7.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
This ratio results in an equilibrium abundance ${\rm [C/Mg]} = -0.09$, which is consistent with the subgiant sample and is within \about{20\%} of the solar C/Mg mixture from \citet{asplund+09}.

In Section \ref{sec:agb_results}, we will show that none of the four \agb\ yield sets (\cxi{}, \kx{}, \vxiii{}, \kxvi{}) produce enough C relative to this $\Ycc$ value. So, we introduce normalization factors, $\alpha_{\rm agb}$, and $\alpha_{\rm CC}$ which denote a multiplicative scaling of $\Ycc$ and $\Ycagb$ respectively. 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:alpha}
    \begin{align}
        \Ycagb &\rightarrow \alpha_{\rm agb}\ \Ycagb \\
        \Ycc &\rightarrow \alpha_{\rm cc}\ \Ycc\\
        \alpha_{\rm CC} &= \frac{\Yct - \alpha_{\rm agb}\ \Ycagb}{\Ycc}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Above, $\alpha_{\rm cc}$ is dependent on the choice of $\alpha_{\rm agb}$ to keep the total C yield constant. 

In Section \ref{sec:agb_results}, we find that $\alpha_{\rm agb}\approx 2.9$ for the \cxi{} yield model. Using this \agb\ yield, we can now use Eq.~\ref{eq:y_c_eq} to find an estimate of $\Ycc$ as a function of metallicity. We show the values of $\Ycc$ we obtain from the subgiant sample in Fig.~\ref{fig:analytic}. From a regression analysis, we suggest here that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zeta}
    \Ycc = 0.004 \left(1 - \zeta + \zeta\,\frac{2Z}{Z + Z_\odot} + \frac{2\xi}{1 + Z/Z_{\rm III}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\zeta\approx0.001$ describes the metallicity dependence.

Blue points are the median value of $\Ycc$ for each bin in [Mg/H] with uncertainties based on the median absolute deviation.
    }
    \label{fig:analytic}
\end{figure}



We also briefly explore an analytic \agb\ model, defined as a cubic piecewise in mass and linear in metallicity.
The piecewise is defined to have a maximum at $m_1$ and minimums at
the end points $m-\delta m_-$ and $m+\delta m_+$. The function becomes constant
outside of this range with (optionally) negative yields.
And the resulting equation (excepting a prefactor)

\begin{equation}
\y(m) = 
\begin{cases}
\y_0 & m \leq m_0 - \delta m_- \\
\y_1 + (\y_0 - \y_1)\; f\!\left(\frac{m_0 - m}{\delta m_-}\right) 
    & m_0 - \delta m_- < m \leq m_0 \\
    \y_1 + (\y_2 - \y_1)\; f\!\left(\frac{m - m_0}{\delta m_+}\right)
    & m_0 < m \leq m_0 + \delta m_+ \\
\y_2 & m_0 + \delta m_+ \leq m
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where 
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x^3
\end{equation}

For the full equation, we take the above functional form multiplied by a
metallicity dependent term, so 

\begin{equation}
    \y_{\rm C}^{\rm agb}(m, Z) = \frac{\y(m) \left[\y_1 + \zeta \log_{10}(Z/Z_\odot) \right]}{\int_1^8 m\,\y(m)\,{\rm IMF}(m)\;dm}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Delayed C}
To parameterize the \agb\ contribution to C production, we define $f_{\rm agb}$ to be the fraction of C which comes from \agb\ stars. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:f_agb}
    f_{\rm agb} \equiv \frac{\Ycagb(Z=\Zo)}{\Yct(Z=\Zo)},
\end{equation}
($\Ycagb$ includes the multiplicative factor $\alpha_{\rm agb}$ as defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:alpha}). 


We can use the \caafe{} diagram of \apogee\ stars to estimate the delayed portion of C. When binned in metallicity, median [C/Mg] changes by about 0.25 dex across the range of [Mg/Fe]. As high-$\alpha$ stars have little to no delayed \ia\ Fe, these stars would also have little to no delayed \agb\ C. This means that AGB C stars make up about at most a fraction $f_{\rm agb} \approx 1 - 10^{-0.25} \approx 0.6$ of C production.




\subsection{Uncertainties}

We only perform this analysis on the \cxi{} yields because \cxi{} has yields tables more finely sampled in metallicity than the other three \agb\ yield tables. As the metallicity range of the data is small ($-0.4\lesssim {\rm [Mg/H]} \lesssim 0.4$), other models are more challenging to interpret in this range. Furthermore, the \apogee{} observations may have systematics. Other measurements of C abundances \citep[e.g.][]{vincenzo+21} have slight disagreements in the overall shape of the trend (see Section \ref{sec:jack}).
So, this expression of $\Ycc/\Yoc$ depends on the chosen \agb\ yield table, the \agb\ fraction, and the dataset. 
Additionally, these yields will be systematically biased if the galaxy is out of equilibrium, for example, due to a recent starburst \citep{mor+19,isern19}. Further exploration could investigate the magnitude of these uncertainties, but we find that the qualitative conclusions are similar despite substantial variations in the assumptions here.



\section{The Multi-zone Model}\label{sec:vice}

Classical, \textit{one-zone} models of chemical evolution assume instantaneous mixing of metals in the star-forming interstellar medium \citep[e.g.][]{matteucci21}. This simple framework is a poor approximation of the Milky Way.  The Galaxy evolves \textit{inside-out}---where star formation is higher towards the center and in the early universe \citep{bird+13}. Additionally, stars can migrate several kpc over their lifetimes, mixing different chemical environments across the galaxy \citep{bird+12,sellwood+binney02}. For the rest of this paper, we focus on multi-zone models, which discretize the Galaxy into concentric rings in which stars move between.  
Our models extends the \citet[hereafter \JJ]{james+21} Milky Way model, run with the publicly available Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (\VICE). 
This model is described extensively in \JJ~and concisely summarized  in \citet{james+23}. Here, we provide a brief overview of the relevant model components.

Our model is as follows. The Galaxy is divided into 200 rings, each 100\,pc wide. Each ring has a separate stellar population and gas supply. We initially assume an inside-out \sfh{}, where the star formation surface density $\Sigma_\star$ is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inside_out}
    \dot{\Sigma}_\star \propto \left(1-e^{-t/\tau_{\rm rise}}\right) e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}.
\end{equation}
$\tau_\text{rise}=2$\,Gyr describes when the star formation rate reaches a maximum, and $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ describes the decay timescale of star formation as a function of radius $R$. \JJ~derives $\tau_{\rm sfh}(R)$ through analysis of four integral field spectroscopy surveys in \cite{sanches20}. At each $R$, the \sfh{} is normalized to match the stellar surface density gradient \citep{BHG16} and the total stellar mass reaches $5.17\times10^{10}\,\Mo$ \citep{LM15}. Star formation ends beyond a radius $R=15.5\,$kpc. 
The gas inflow is calculated to maintain our chosen \sfh{} for each radius and time, using an extension of a Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{kennicutt98},
\begin{equation}
\dot{\Sigma}_{\star} \propto 
\begin{cases}
    {\Sigma}_{\rm gas} & 2\times 10^7 \leq \Sigma_{\rm gas} \\ 
    {(\Sigma}_{\rm gas})^{3.6} & 5\times 10^6 \leq \Sigma_{\rm gas} < 2\times10^7 \\ 
    {(\Sigma}_{\rm gas})^{1.7} & \Sigma_{\rm gas} < 5\times10^6 \\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation} 
where $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ is measured in \Mo\,kpc$^{-2}$. 
The scaling of this relationship varies with time due to the redshift dependence of $\tau_\star$ in molecular gas observed by \citet{tacconi18}. We assume a \citet{kroupa01} \imf.


To account for radial migration, \JJ\ used the \texttt{h277} hydrodynamical
simulation results \citep{christensen12, zolotov12, loebman12, BZ14}. Simulation parameters are described in \citet{bird+21}. 
Each \VICE\ single stellar population (SSP) is matched to an \textit{analog} in \texttt{H277}, chosen to form at a similar time and radius $R$. By taking the change in radius $\Delta R$ of the analogs, the SSPs move to their final radii with a $\sqrt{\text{time}}$ dependence.
The $\Delta R \propto \sqrt{\rm time}$ dependence arises when migration proceeds as a consequence of the diffusion of angular momentum \citep{frankel18, frankel20}.
We do not account for radial gas flows.
Using the results of a hydrodynamical simulation without modification limits the free parameters in the model; however, we am limited to one dynamical history. 
We do explore a normal-distribution random walk migration based on \citet{frankel18}, without noticeable impacts on our results. All models shown here use the \texttt{h277}-based migration. The full impact of the details of a galaxy's dynamical history on its chemical evolution is still unknown.

As the strength of outflows controls the resulting $\alpha$-element abundances, \JJ~create a metallicity gradient by defining
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta_r}
\eta(R) = r - 1 + \frac{y_{\alpha}^{\rm CC}}{Z_{\alpha, \odot}} 10^{(-0.08\,\text{kpc}^{-1})(R-4\,\text{kpc})+0.3}.
\end{equation}
This choice of $\eta(R)$ results in a [$\alpha$/H] gradient consistent with Milky Way observations \citep[e.g.][]{hayden+14, weinberg+19, frinchaboy+13}.


\section{Results}
\subsection{Data Selection}

Subgiants provide the ideal observational constraint to our model. Since first dredge up changes C surface abundances in evolved stars, these stars require model-dependent corrections to recover surface abundances \citep[e.g.][]{vincenzo+21}. On the other hand, gravitational settling can affect main sequence stellar abundances \citep[e.g.][]{souto19}. Subgiants have well-mixed envelopes, so gravitational settling is not as significant, and subgiants have not yet experienced first dredge up. We use a sample of \apogee\ DR17 stars \citep{apogee17} as selected in \citetjack. We only compare the models to the low-$\alpha$ sequence (representing the thin disk) unless otherwise specified.  The selection criteria and differences between the samples are described in more detail in Appendix~\ref{sec:jack}.




\subsection{Evolution of Carbon Abundances}

Here, we present the time evolution of our fiducial model. In the next sections, we will discuss the choice of parameters and agreement with observations. 
The fiducial model has the following qualitative characteristics of its C yields.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item C is mostly (\about{80\%}) produced in \cc
    \item \cc\ produce more C at higher metallicities
    \item \agb\ stars produce less C at higher metallicities 
\end{enumerate} 
The fiducial model uses the \cxi{} \agb\ yield tables uniformly scaled by a factor of 2.9 (see Section \ref{sec:agb}, and Table \ref{tab:fiducial_mod}). 

Fig.~\ref{fig:c_evo} shows time evolution tracks of the fiducial model for \caah\ and \caafe. 
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:equilibrium}, \caah\ is set by the total C/Mg yields. 
\caafe\ is instead useful in understanding delayed C production. 
As both Fe and C are delayed elements, [Mg/Fe] steadily decreases after a star formation event, unlike [Mg/H] which quickly reaches equilibrium.  All plots showing \caafe\ going forward are selected in metallicity such that $-0.15 \leq {\rm [Mg/H]} \leq -0.05$, so metallicity-dependent yields do not affect this plot. 
The \caafe{}-diagram is, in essance, an emperical delay-time-distribution for a single stellar population of C, especially as we assume a $\propto t^{-1.1}$ delay-time-distribution for Fe. 
Comparing the top and bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:c_evo} highlights the differences between \caah\ and \caafe. While \caah\ quickly reaches its final equilibrium distribution (within \about{5}\,Gyr), \caafe\ continues to evolve in both [Mg/Fe] and [C/Mg] until the simulation ends.

C evolution proceeds as follows, (for a single zone)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cc\ initially dominate production. As $\Ycc$ has strong metallicity dependence, [C/Mg] increases with time. 
    \item \agb stars contribute delayed C, causing [C/Mg] to increase even faster with [Mg/H]. 
    \item[(iii)] [C/Mg] plateaus as C also approaches equilibrium. 
    \item[(iv)] [C/Mg] may decrease due to declining SFH or slightly negative yields from \about{1}\,\Mo stars.

\end{enumerate}

\end{figure*}



Fig.~\ref{fig:f_agb_evo} shows $f_{\rm agb}$ calculated from the fiducial model of current effective C yields in the gas phase (using the SFH as a proxy for $\Ycc$. 
At early times, \cc\ dominate. As the galaxy evolves, \agb\ have time to add C, increasing $f_{\rm agb}$. However, the metal-rich inner regions lower \agb\ C yields, so these regions never reach as high of a $f_{\rm agb}$ as the outer regions do.

\end{figure}


\subsection{High-mass stellar yields}\label{sec:results_highmass}
\cc, which likely make up the majority of C, set the overal C abundances. 
 and the \cc\ metallicity dependence $\zeta$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:first_models}. Fig.~\ref{fig:first_models} shows models with varying $\Ycc$ metallicity dependence. As the \caah~trend is approximated by the equilibrium C/Mg abundance with metallicity, the models with stronger metallicity dependence have a stronger slope in \caah. However, \caafe~is minimally affected by these changes since \cc\ occurs on much shorter timescales than \ia\ and \agb\ enrichment, and we only consider stars in a small metallicity range for \caafe.

Black points and grey dashes represent the median and standard deviations of [C/Mg] for each [Mg/H] bin in the \citetjack~sample. In the right panel, we show the trends only for stars where $-0.15\leq {\rm [Mg/H]}\leq -0.05$.
}
\label{fig:first_models}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Low mass stellar yields}\label{sec:agb_results}


Fig.~\ref{fig:agb_sims} compares the \kx{}, \kxvi{}, \cxi{}, and \vxiii{} yield models. As the highest \agb\ yield at solar, \kx{} is only $\Ycagb=0.000585$, so $f_{\rm agb} \leq 0.12$ for all models. 
Massive stars dominate C production with unscaled yields.  
With the exception of \vxiii, the different \agb\ models only affect the overall metallicity dependence (in \caah). We leave a more detailed discussion of the effects of \agb\ models for Appendix~\ref{sec:oob_models} and use \cxi{} (OR ANALYTIC?) yields hereafter.


\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2in, width=6in]{agb_oob.pdf}

\caption[]{Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:first_models}, except where each line corresponds to one of our four \agb\ yield sets (\cxi, \kx, \vxiii, \kxvi).}
\label{fig:agb_sims}
\end{figure*}


Here, we investigate adjustments to the \agb\ yield fraction $f_{\rm agb}$
Fig.~\ref{fig:f_agb} shows three models with different \agb\ fractions while using \cxi{} yields.  The \caafe~relationship is set by $f_{\rm agb}$ because a specific amount of C must be released at a delayed time to match the \ia\ production of Fe and increase [C/Mg] as [Mg/Fe] decreases to reproduce the data.
Increased $f_{\rm agb}$ results in a decreased slope in \caah, owing to the negative metallicity dependence of $\Ycagb$. So while \caah~alone cannot differentiate models which vary $f_{\rm agb}$ and $\zeta$ correspondingly, \caafe~provides information on $f_{\rm agb}$. So, we can use \caafe~to estimate $f_{\rm agb}\approx 0.2$, and then choose $\zeta$ to match \caah.



Negative \agb\ yields cause a morphological change in the abundance trends. If the yields of low mass stars are negative, then at late times in a SSP, C abundances will decrease. This will appear as a downturn in the \caafe{} abundance trends as [Mg/Fe] approaches solar values. As we do not observe this in the data, this is either obscured by \sfh\ (Seee eeee) or observational scatter. 
Instead, if lower-intermediate mass \agb\ stars produce negative carbon yields, it is possible to observe this as a dip in the early parts of the \caafe{} trend...

\subsection{Star Formation History} \label{sec:sfh}

In this section, we consider two modifications of our fiducial \sfh{}: \textit{lateburst} and \textit{earlyburst}.
Our lateburst model adds a Gaussian factor to the inside-out \sfh{},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:late-burst}
    \dot{\Sigma}_\text{lateburst} \propto \dot{\Sigma}_\text{inside-out} \left(1 + A\,e^{-(t-\tau_{\rm burst})^2/2\sigma^2_{\rm burst}} \right)
\end{equation}
where $A=1.5$ represents the amplitude of the birth, $\tau_\text{burst}=10.8$\,Gyr is the time where the burst is strongest, and $\sigma_\text{burst}=1$\,Gyr is the width of the burst.
Our earlyburst model is similar, but the burst is exponential and placed at $t_1=5$\,Gyr. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twoinfall}
    \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm earlyburst} \propto \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm inside-out} + 
\begin{cases}
    A\,e^{-(t-t_1)/\tau_{\rm burst}} & t_1 < t \\
      0 & t<t_1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we take the burst duration, $\tau_{\rm burst}=1$\,Gyr.
This approximately corresponds to the Gaia-Encelidus merger, inducing higher star formation in the Milky Way \citep{spitoni21, bonaca20, helmi18}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:sfh_models} shows three models with these alternate \sfh{}. Changes to the \sfh{} leave \caah\ unchanged, but they do introduce slight variation in \caafe. Models with higher \agb{} fractions are more sensitive to variations in the \sfh{}. The late burst models result in [C/Mg] continuing to increase at low [Mg/Fe], but also introduce a dip not present in the data. Additionally, the early burst
reproduces the slight break between the low and high $\alpha$ sequences, but overshoots equilibrium more severely than the fiducial model. 
In general, any of these \sfh{}s are consistent with this model.

\subsection{Degeneracies} \label{sec:outflows}


\gce{} models of the Milky Way fall into two classes---those which incorporate significant mass-loading (e.g., this work) and those which neglect mass-loading but lower effective yield to match observed abundances \citep[e.g.][]{MCM13, MCM14, spitoni19, spitoni20, spitoni21}.
An increase in stellar yields has a nearly identical effect as a decrease in the mass-loading factor $\eta$ (see Appendix B of \citealt{james_dwarf}).
The equilibrium arguments discussed in Section \ref{sec:equilibrium} suggest however that abundance ratios are independent of the choice of normalization and the value of $\eta$. We, therefore, expect our results regarding the relative yield $y_{\rm C}/y_{\rm Mg}$ and its metallicity dependence to extend to the other class of models omitting mass loading. We demonstrate this further here.

The theoretical motivation for decreasing yields is the uncertainty in stellar explodability.
If fewer \hms\ explode, then the yields will be reduced by some factor. Additionally, some fraction of supernovae ejecta may be lost directly to an outflow, lowering effective yields. To explore reduced outflow models, we lower both $\eta$ and all yields by the same factor to leave the equilibrium abundances unchanged. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:eta} shows models with variations of the mass loading strength. While changing the value of $\eta$ affects the metallicity distribution of stars, all of the models in Fig.~\ref{fig:eta} still evolve along the same path. Our model is unable to differentiate a uniform decrease in both outflows and yields.

An addition source of theoretical uncertainty in this result is that the \ia\ yield and delay time distributions have their own uncertainties. We discuss variations in $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}$ in NOWHERE, and find that the qualitative conclusions are largely unaffected. We, therefore, focus on the choices of $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} = 0.00214$ and a $t^{-1.1}$ delay time distribution choices from the fiducial model here.
In short, the scaling of the trend and metallicity dependence of C (as seen in
the \caah\ trend) gives information on the total C yield and the behavior of \cc\ (as the dominating producer of C), the \caafe\ trend exposes the delayed effect of C from \agb\ contribution.

\subsection{Gas-Phase Abundances}\label{sec:gas}

Measurements of C abundances are challenging. In HII regions, C/O abundance ratios are measured with either recombination lines or collisional excitation lines. However C lacks strong collisional excitation lines, and recombination lines fall in the ultraviolet without nearby reference H lines \citep{skillman+20}. Additionally, recombination and collisional excitation measurements disagree by a factor of \about{2} \citep{GR07}.
Variations in the \sfh{}s may furthermore increase scatter, as \agb\ are a delayed source of C. C abundances are challenging to measure. When a star enters the Red Giant Branch (RGB), material from the CNO-processed core is mixed with the envelope in first dredge up, enhancing N and depleting C \citep{iben67, vincenzo+21,KL14}. Measurements of these evolved stars'  atmospheres will no longer reflect their birth abundances.  Additionally, gas-phase measurements of C are extremely limited as C lacks strong lines in HII regions \citep{skillman+20}.


As an additional test of the model, we next compare the model predictions against gas-phase measurements. Fig.~\ref{fig:gas_phase} shows the fiducial model's gas-phase predictions compared to observations of the Milky Way and extragalactic HII regions, halo stars, and damped Lyman-alpha systems. The model is broadly consistent with observations, where the model at $t=2$\,Gyr approximates the slope of dwarf galaxies and halo stars. The increase of C/O at higher metallicities is also consistent with the high C/O abundances measured in extragalactic HII regions. 
Our model does not extend to very low metallicity, where the slope of the trend inverts, but broadly explains observations above $\rm [O/H] \gtrsim -1$. 

Mg measurements are more reliable, but O abundances are easier to measure in HII regions. So while we use Mg as the representative alpha for stellar abundances, we instead use O when comparing gas-phase abundances. As we assume ${\rm[Mg/O]}=0$, our model is independent of the choice of the $\alpha$-element.


The elevated [C/O] abundance at very-low metallicities is likely due to population III stellar yields \citep[e.g.][]{hirschi07}, as suggested by \citet{cooke+17} and \citet{FN15}. \agb\ stars cannot explain the increase in C yields at low metallicity in the damped Lyman-alphas sample as the evolutionary timescales of damped Lyman-alpha systems are shorter than the typical delay time distribution of \agb\ stars.

\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we investigate the role of C yields on the predictions of multi-zone \gce{} models. 

As \cc\ C yields are poorly understood, we adopt an equilibrium approximation and determine a functional form that approximately matches trends in \apogee{} subgiant and is consistent with high-mass nucleosynthesis models. Variations of the metallicity dependence of this \cc\ yield affect trends in \caah~but do not affect trends in \caafe\ (when taking a slice in [Mg/H]). As all theoretical \agb\ C yields decrease with metallicity, increasing the \agb\ fraction causes the \caah\ trend to flatten. However, the \caafe\ trend is sensitive to the \agb\ fraction. 
From this, we estimate that \agb\ stars contribute \about{20\%} of total C abundance at solar metallicity. The remaining \about{80\%} of C comes from high-mass stars with a metallicity dependent yield of $\Ycc/\Yoc=1.51 + 0.54 (Z/Z_\odot)$. 
This metallicity dependence is roughly consistent with rotating stellar yields.
 

We additionally explore variations of the assumed \sfh{} and outflow mass-loading factor $\eta$. We find that alternate \sfh{}s can slightly affect \caafe, but \caah~is mostly unaffected. Decreasing both outflows and yields by the same factor leaves the \caah~and \caafe~trends unaffected. These constraints on the relative yields of C, O, and Mg are robust against variations in $\eta$.

Finally, we compare our model against gas-phase measurements and metal-poor stars. While our model was built on data near solar metallicity, observations of very low metallicity, high redshift damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems indicate higher C/O ratios \citep{cooke+17}, consistent with yields from population III stars \citep[e.g.][]{hirschi07}. Population III stars, \cc\, and \agb\ stars altogether explain the observed evolutionary history of C.

These C yield constraints provide a useful benchmark for stellar evolution models. C yields are sensitive to poorly understood processes, including mass-loss prescriptions, explodability, nuclear cross sections, convection, and stellar structure. Future spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia kinematics \citep{gaia} will continue to enhance our understanding of chemical evolution. Both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V's Milky Way Mapper program ({\sc SDSS-V/MWM}) \citep{sdssv} and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ({\sc DESI}) Milky Way survey \citep{desi, desi:mw} will each measure spectra of upwards 6,000,000 Milky Way stars. These larger samples will enable similar work to tighten constraints on stellar models and our understanding of galaxy structure and evolution. MAYBE MENTION METAL-POOR OR OTHER PROJECTS?

\section{The Subgiant Sample}\label{sec:jack}

As the primary observational constraint, we use the criteria outlined in \citetjack~to create a sample of subgiant from \apogee{} DR17 \citep{apogee17}. apogee is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measures high-resolution spectra of thousands of stars \cite{sdss17}. Chemical abundances are determined from the \apogee\ Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline ({\sc aspcap}) \citep{aspcap}.  


Photospheric C and N abundances in subgiant are reflective of their birth abundances \citep{gilroy89, korn+07, lind+08, souto+18, souto19} As first dredge up, which affects C and N abundances, only occurs during the ascent onto the RGB, subgiant stars are unaffected by this enrichment. 

An alternate approach for this analysis would be to estimate the birth abundances of RGB stars by correcting surface abundance effects from first dredge up as in \cite{vincenzo+21}. Subgiants are the more attractive option since these observations do not rely on model-dependent corrections. However, RGB stars are more luminous, potentially allowing better coverage of the Galactic disk.


We choose to use \citetjack\ sample as this does not rely on additional layers of modeling, providing a more direct constraint to our model and limiting our systematic uncertainties.



Fig.~\ref{fig:subgiant_selection} shows a plot of all \apogee\ stars and the \citetjack polygon selection criteria. 
 \citetjack~select a region of stars based on surface gravity $\log g$, and effective surface temperature, $T_\text{eff}$.
 \begin{equation}
    \begin{cases} \label{eq:subgiant_selection}
        \log \text{g} \geq 3.5 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq 0.004\,T_{\rm eff} - 15.7 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq 0.000706\,T_{\rm eff} + 0.36 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq -0.0015\,T_{\rm eff} + 12.05 \\
        \log \text{g} \geq 0.0012\,T_{\rm eff} - 2.8. \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Additionally, we included stars in \apogee{} marked by the following flags.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|APOGEE_MIRCLUSTER_STAR|
\item \verb|APOGEE_EMISSION_STAR|
\item \verb|APOGEE_EMBEDDEDCLUSTER_STAR|
\item \verb|young cluster (IN-SYNC)|
\item \verb|APOGEE2_W345|
\item \verb|EB planet|
\end{itemize}
This cut isolates a clean sample of \about{12,000} subgiants.
We furthermore isolate the low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences with the cut
\begin{equation}\label{eq:high_alpha}
\begin{cases}
\text{[Mg/Fe]} >0.12-0.13\,\text{[Fe/H]}, & \text{[Fe/H]}<0\\
\text{[Mg/Fe]} >0.12, & \text{[Fe/H]}>0. \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The low-$\alpha$ sequence is better reproduced by this model, so we use this cut of the subgiants to compare the models against except for comparing \caafe.

Models include masses 1.3, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 \Mo; and 
metallicities $Z = $ 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.014, 0.02. 

\hypertarget{K10}{\texttt{K10}}.

and metallicities $Z=$ 0.0001, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02. 

\hypertarget{V13}{\texttt{V13}}

\vxiii is evololved with DHFJKSLDF,
\vxiii is unusual in that hot bottom burning is much stronger than other models, resulting in much lower stellar yields and negative yields above solar metallicities.

Models include masses 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0 \Mo; 
and metallicities $Z=$ 0.0003, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.014, 0.04.
This yield set was extended up to metallicities of 0.1 in DFJSD; however, we do not consider this range here.
