Stellar evolution models provide highly uncertain predictions for elemental yields due to our limited understanding of stellar physics. In this paper, I aim to estimate the nucleosynthetic yields of carbon using galactic chemical evolution models.

\chapter{Introduction}

Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) aims to understand the chemical and star formation history of galaxies. At the core of GCE models are stellar yields---the amount of each chemical element stars produce (or destroy). Different chemical elements are produced in different sites, so stars leave traces of the Galaxy's chemical history. Through \textit{Galactic Archeology}, we can reconstruct the history of our galaxy by investigating the clues left in the remains---stars from the early universe \citep{Weinberg+22, emily+19}.

I aim to understand the GCE of carbon, where the element is produced and how the abundances of this element evolve over time. Why stuy carbon? Carbon is unique nucleosynthetically, one of few light elements (along with nitrogen) which are produced in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars \citep[for example,][]{jennifer19, KL14}. Carbon and nitrogen are well studied elements as they are easy to observe in stellar spectra, even at the lowest metallicities \citep{FN15} SOMETHING ELSE?. Additionally, carbon and nitrogen are used as age indicators in red giant branch stars \citep[e.g.][]{martig16, MG15, fiorenzo+21}.
While we know carbon is produced in AGB stars and core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), we still have limited understanding of the importaince and metallicity-dependence of each process.


We also know that there is evidence for non-monatonic carbon yield patterns. 
pattern where carbon is more readily produced by both high metallicity and very low metallicity stars (CEMPS, early GCE results), but our picture. \citep{FN15,cooke+17,berg+19}.

Stellar evolution models predict stellary yields, playing a crucial role in GCE.  However, these models are rife with uncertainties, limited by our understanding of critical physical processes such as nuclear reaction rates, convection, rotational mixing, opacity, and mass loss CITATIONS. Changes in opacity, rotation, reaction rates, and explodability can substantially affect carbon yields \citep{KL14,V13, LC18, emily+21}.

GCE models typically use unmodified nucleosythetic predictions and attempt to create models matching observaions by varying star formation history and other parameters. I instead use the observations as a constraint, determining which yield assuptions are consistant with galactic abundance trends. 

While there are many stellar measurments of carbon, accurately determining the birth abundance is more challenging. For example, when a star becomes a RGB star, material from the CNO-processed core \citep{fiorenzo+21,KL14}. Since this core-processed material is now carbon depleted and nitrogen enhanced, measurments of this star's atmosphere will no longer reflect the birth abundances of the star.  Additionaly, carbon is faint in HII regions and determining gas-phase abundances is challenging \citet{skillman+20}.
Other surveys, such as GALAH, have unreliable carbon measurments with low detection rates \citep{emily+19}.

AGB stars are known to be importaint (cite) from stellar model predictions, previous GCE, and evidence from abundance patterns. (are there detections in PN?)

CCSne are also important (.... SN reminant measurments)


In Fig. \ref{fig:subgiants}, I present a sample of APOGEE subgiants. These subgiants were chosen based on their location in the HR diagram based on the criteria in \citet{jack_subgiant} also replicated in Appendix \ref{sec:jack}. Because subgiants have not undergone FDU, their surface abundances are an accurate reflection of the birth abundances (CITATION).

\chapter{Nucleosynthesis}

Modern theoretical nucleosynthesis provides the starting point for our models.  I focus on three primary nucleosynthetic pathways: AGB stars, CCSne, and SNeIa. Each process has unique timescales and element production which I can trace through the tools of GCE. While carbon is only known to be produced in AGB stars and CCSNe, comparing carbon to iron production (from SNeIa) adds a valuable constraint to our models and insight into the delay-time production of carbon.

After a group of stars are formed, CCSNe from massive stars are the first enrichment, providing light elements such as C, O, and Mg and heavier elements such as Fe and beyond. Importaintly, $\alpha$ elements like O and Mg are only formed in CCSNe (in significant quantities). Next, low mass stars begin to reach the end of their lives. The dying breaths of AGB stars are known to be importaint sources of C, N, and a smattering of heavier elements.  Finally, the white dwarfs, including formation and time to collide/over-eat, explode, releasing much of Fe and nearby elements. 

I focus on O and Mg as $\alpha$ elements only formed in CCSNe, and use Fe to
trace delayed enrichment from SNeIa. C and N are both formed in AGB and CCSNe.

There are two $\alpha$-elements I care about: Mg and O. Stellar observations
of magnesium are more reliable but oxygen abundances are easier to measure in
HII regions. I assume that both Mg and O are produced entirely in CCSNe with
constant, metallicity-independent yields. Thus $\text{[Mg/H]} = \text{[O/H]} =
[\alpha/\text{H}]$ in our models. (Observational validation?)

For carbon, the dominant producer is from massive stars which eject carbon fused in their cores during CCSNe. 

To calculate the net initial mass function (IMF)-weighted yields, I use the \citet{james+21} model (hereafter \JJ) with the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution code (\VICE).
As stellar evolution models predict per-star yields for stars of each mass, we need to integrate over the IMF to determine the total yields in terms of star formation.

As the focus of this work is on carbon yields, I keep all other yields fixed. The yields I use are based on \citet{james+21, james+22}. 

Also following \citet{james+21, james+22}, I take the SNeIa Delay Time distribution to be a
$t^{-1.1}$ law suggested by the observations of \citet{maoz+12}.

\section{Asymptotic giant branch stars}\label{sec:agb}


An AGB star is a low mass ($\lesssim 8 M_{\sun}$) star during the final phases of evolution.  In an AGB star, two competing processes determine the outcome of carbon production.
Third Dredge Up (TDU) is needed to eject carbon from the star, enriching the surface with helium-burning-processed material from the core. But Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) at the base of the convection layer changes carbon into nitrogen. 
TDU occurs during thermal pulsations, where the convective layer of the star passes into the inner layers with He-burning products which mixes in C and O into the envelope. In contrast, HBB may happen if the base of the convective envelope reaches about 50MK, initiating the CNO cycle, converting most C12 into N14. 

Carbon abundances are strongly affected by CNO cycle processing in stars. The CNO cycle is one of two series of nuclear reactions( $^{12}$C(p, $\gamma$)$^{13}$N($\beta^+ \nu_e$)$^{14}$N(p, $\gamma$)$^{15}$O($\beta^+\nu_e$)$^{15}$N(p,$\alpha$)$^{12}$C

Because the $^{14}$N(p, $\alpha$) proton capture is the slowest component of the CNO cycle ****, the CNO cycle, to first order, converts all $^{12}$C into $^{14}N$. 

The differences in yields between AGB models depend on the mass loss rate, treatment of convection, and nuclear reaction rates. 

In this work, I explore four different sets of AGB star yields representative of the variety of options which also provide reasonably well sampled grids in metallicity and mass necessary for chemical evolution studies.
\begin{itemize}
    \item C11: \citet{cristallo+11} and \citet{cristallo+15}
    \item K10: \citet{karakas10}
    \item V13: \citet{ventura+13}
    \item K16: \citet{KL16} \citet{karakas+18}
\end{itemize}
Unless otherwise noted, C11 is the model I choose as our fiducial AGB yield. 

I use IMF-Integrated yields calculated with \VICE~throughout this paper (see
section \ref{sec:vice}, \citet{james+21, james+22}). For an element X and star
with mass $M$, the stellar yield $y$ is defined as the net production of X relative 
to $M$, or
\begin{equation}
    y_{\rm X} = \frac{M_{\rm X,\ ejected} - Z_{0, X} M_{\rm ejected}}{M}   
\end{equation}
where I let $M_{\rm ejected}$ and $M_{\rm X, ejected}$ be the total ejected
stellar mass (through winds and supernovae ejecta) and the ejected mass of X,
and $Z_{0, X}$ was the birth mass fraction of element X.

More useful for GCE are Initial Mass Function (IMF) yields, where I sum up the
contributions of all stars which produce an element.
I define the IMF-integrated yield of X with: 
\begin{equation}
Y_{\rm X}^{\rm proc}(Z) = \int_{M_{\rm min}}^{M_{\rm max}} y_{\rm X}^{\rm proc}(M, Z)\ \Phi(M)  \ dM
\end{equation}
Where $\Phi(M) = \frac{dN}{dM}/ \int_{M_{\rm min}}^{M_{\rm max}} \frac{dN}{dM}\ dM$ is the normalized IMF, $M_{\rm min}$ and $M_{\rm max}$ are the minimum and maximum mass of stars, which I take to be $0.08 M_{\sun}$ and $100 M_{\sun}$ respectively; and $\frac{dN}{dM}$ is the initial mass function, the frequency of stars born between $M$ and $M+dM$.


Fig. \ref{fig:y_agb} compares the net fractional AGB carbon yield, $m_\text{C}^\text{AGB}(M, Z)$ for each AGB model I consider. Note that the yields may be negative when the birth abundance is higher than the carbon abundance of the material ejected back to the ISM. 

Most models agree on the qualitative shape of the net fractional AGB carbon yield. The stars with the highest fractional carbon yields are between 2 to 4 solar masses, depending on the metallicity and model. Both lower and higher mass stars produce less carbon, and high mass stars may even destroy carbon at high metallicity due to highly efficient HBB. And all models agree that the carbon yield generally decreases with metallicity. 


Metallicity dependence:
V13 is the only model that stands out, showing a non-monotonic metallicity dependence, however this effect is only for models with [M/H]$\leq -1$. Otherwise the major differences between the models are the precise amount of carbon and the slope of the metallicity dependence. For example, the three models C11, K10, and K16 predict $y_\text{C}^\text{AGB}$ to be between 0.006 and 0.008 at solar metallicity, but C11 has a much shallower metallicity dependence than the K10 and K16 models. And at solar, V13 predicts a value at around 0.004 so the models are all within about a factor of 2. 

Another difference is the speed at which equilibrium is reached. K10 and K16 weight carbon production more heavily towards massive stars resulting in a faster time to equilibrium, whereas the C11 and V13 models predict a slightly longer timescale with order 1Gyr, but little to no carbon is produced more than 2Gyr after a star formation event. This is in contrast to iron which is still produced by SNeIa up to 10Gyr after a star formation event.

\section{Core collapse supernovae}


Massive stars form $^{12}$C through the triple--$\alpha$ process. However, the carbon has to get out of the star to be useful. 
While there are many stellar models providing predictions of CCSNe yields, the results of these models are highly uncertain due to the many stellar modeling uncertainties. 

I summarise many of the predictions of stellar models in Fig. \ref{fig:y_cc}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c_mg_cc}
    {\rm [C/O]^{CC}} = \log_{10}\left( \frac{y_{\rm C}^{\rm CC}}{y_{\rm O}^{\rm CC}}\right) - \log_{10} \left( \frac{Z_{C, \sun }}{Z_{O, \sun }} \right)
\end{equation}
Notice how even these ratios 



    \begin{itemize}
        \item Wide range in predictions, exacerbated to 1 dex range when including variance in oxygen predictions
        \item (explain) most models have a near-metallicity independent oxygen yield, so I choose the fiducial value of 0.015 despite varience in $y_O^{cc}$
        \item The fiducial value, where I choose the carbon yield from Sukhbold+16, may be above most predictions of carbon yields but is within the range of yield ratios
        \item the fiducial value would reach an equilibrium carbon yield of -0.1 without AGB stars
        \item Rotation in LC18 appears to increase metallicity dependence of carbon production (read this paper more carefully)
        \item NKT and LC agree in positive metallicity depenent yields
    \end{itemize}

\chapter{The Equilibrium Approximation}\label{sec:equilibrium}

Chemical abundances reach an equilibrium. At least with simple enough assumptions. The new elements synthesized in stars balance against elements lost to galactic winds and locked in stellar reminants. While our galaxy is likely not in perfect equilibrium or described by a single, homogenous chemical region, I can still use an equilibrium approximation to understand total yields \citep[e.g.][]{james_dwarf,james+22,WAF17}. 

Following the formalism of \citet{WAF17}, I assume a simple one-zone chemical evolution model. The gas and stars are considered to be homogenously and instantaneusly mixed, so I can represent all quantaties as scalars.
I define $M_{X}$ to be the mass of element X in the gas phase, $\dot{M}_\star$ to be the star fomation rate (in M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). $\eta$ is the mass loading factor, $\eta=\dot{M}_{\rm outflow}/\dot{M}_\star$, representing the strength of outflows. $r$ is the recycling fraction, i.e. the net fraction of new star formation which will be returned to the ISM. 

Given the total IMF-weighted yield of magnesium, $y_{\rm Mg}$, I can write the change in the ISM mass of magnesium, $\dot{M}_{\rm Mg}$ as the sum of newly produced elements, elements lost inside stellar remanents, and elements lost to galactic outflows.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d{M}_{\rm Mg}}{dt} = \dot{M}_{\rm Mg,~new} - \dot{M}_{\rm Mg~reminants} - \dot{M}_{\rm Mg,~outflows}
\end{equation}
The newly produced mass can be written in terms of the yield, $\dot{M}_{X,\rm~new}=y_X\dot{M}_\star$. In terms of the return mass fraction of stars $r$, the mass lost to reminants is $Z_X (1-r)\dot{M}_\star$.  And, the outflows deplete a mass $Z_X \eta\dot{M}_\star$. Substituting, 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d{M}_{X}}{dt} = y_{X} \dot{M}_\star - (1 + \eta - r) Z_{X} \dot{M}_\star
\end{equation}
\citep{WAF17}.
Assuming an exponentially declining star formation history, $\dot{M}_\star \propto e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}$, this equation can be solved analytically. 
To find equilibrium, set $\dot{M}_X=0$, and now
\begin{equation}\label{eq:z_eq}
    Z_{\rm Mg}^{\rm eq}(R) = \frac{y_{\rm Mg}}{1 + \eta(R) - r - \tau_\star / \tau_{sfh}}
\end{equation}
For constant star formation, $\tau_\star/\tau_{\rm sfh} \rightarrow 0$

While Equation \ref{eq:z_eq} can be applied to CCSNe carbon, the delayed time contribution of AGB carbon can complicate the result. Instead, using an effective or DTD-integrated yield, $\langle \Ycagb \rangle$
\begin{equation}
    \langle \Ycagb\rangle = \frac{\int_0^T \tilde{y}_{\rm C}^{\rm agb}(M, Z) \dot{M}_\star(T - t) \frac{dN}{dM} \frac{dM}{dt} dt  }{ \dot{M}_\star \int_0^T \frac{dN}{dM} \frac{dM}{dt} dt}
\end{equation}
So, for carbon, Equation \ref{eq:z_eq} becomes
\begin{equation}
    Z_{\rm C}^{\rm eq}(R) = \frac{\Ycc + \langle\Ycagb\rangle}{1 + \eta(R) - r - \tau_\star / \tau_{sfh}}
\end{equation}
Taking the ratio of $Z_{\rm C}$ and $Z_{\rm Mg}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:z_co}
    \frac{Z_{\rm C}^{\rm eq}}{Z_{\rm Mg}^{\rm eq}} = \frac{\Ycc + \langle \Ycagb \rangle }{\Yoc}
\end{equation}

With these definitions, I can calculate the core collapse yields of carbon as a function of metallicity:
\begin{equation}
    y_\text{C}^\text{CC} =  y_\text{Mg}^\text{CC} \frac{Z_\text{C,~eq}}{Z_\text{Mg,~eq}} - \langle y_c^{agb} \rangle
\end{equation}

Rewriting in terms of the observed abundance ratio and dividing by
$y_\text{Mg}^\text{CC}$. So, given the outflows or CCSNe oxygen yields, the
carbon AGB yield, and the \caah mean abundance track, I can estimate the CCSNe carbon yield. Written as a relative yield:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Ycc}{\Yoc} = \frac{Z_{\text{C},~\sun}}{Z_{\text{Mg},~\sun}} 10^{[C/Mg]} - \frac{\langle \Ycagb \rangle}{\Yoc}
\end{equation}

Fitting this relationship to data (figure \ref{fig:analytic}).

\section{Yield Models}

Outflow yield degeneracy.
One challenge of chemical evolution models is that outflows and yields are degenerate. To avoid this degeneracy, I instead constrain relative yields. As Equation \ref{eq:z_co} shows, the yield ratios are independent of $\eta$, and independent of the SFH (ignoring the DTD term).
As such, I set the total carbon yields to 
\begin{equation}
    \Yct = \Ycc + \Ycagb = 0.005 \frac{\Yoc}{0.00185}
\end{equation}

is reasonably consistant with the value in \citet{asplund+09} of $Z_{\rm
C}/Z_{\rm O}=0.413$ and was chosen as to match the median value of our sample
at $Z=Z_{\sun }$. 

Additionally, each AGB yield set (C11, K10, V13, K16), fails to produce enough AGB carbon for our fiducial model (see REF). So, I introduce a process factor, $\alpha_{\rm AGB}$, which represents the multiplicative increase in $\Ycagb$ from the published yields.
\begin{equation}
    \Ycagb \rightarrow \alpha_{\rm agb}  \Ycagb.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{\rm agb} = f_{\rm agb} \frac{\Yct}{\Ycagb}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{\rm CC} = (1 - f_{\rm agb}) \frac{\Yct}{\Ycc}
\end{equation}

I have investigated uniform increases in carbon yields and have found these changes make little effect on the resulting trends. Fixing the total carbon yield at solar reduces the number of free parameters and keeps the model reasonably consistant with observations, and enables us to more consistantly explore differen AGB models.

\section{Uncertainties}

I only perform this analysis on the C11 yields because the range of metallicities of the data (about [M/H] = -0.4, 0.4) only represents about 2 AGB models, relying heavily on our choice of extrapolation. C11 have a finer model grid, allowing us to have 5 theoretical predicted points within this metallicity range, allowing us to be more certain of our conclusion. 

I do note that this analysis fails to take into account selection effects and biases in APOGEE, and a more robust determination of the carbon yield. 


This formulation is degenerate in $\varpi$ until I estimate a better AGB fraction. As the seperation between the low and high alpha sequences can be used to estimate the delayed time contribution to carbon, using the model to estimate this value relies heavaly on the details of the SFH in addition to the 
I do give an estimate of the CCSNe yields, however this is dependent on our choice of $\eta$. Other choices of $\eta$ vary the value significantly in both magnitude and slope (as AGB contributions increase, I need less CCSNe carbon, however the CCSNe carbon must have a higher metallicity dependence to replicate the V21 data). 



\chapter{The Multizone Model}\label{sec:vice}

Classical, ``one-zone'' models of chemical evolution assume instantanius mixing of metals in the star forming ISM \citep[e.g.][]{matteucci21}. This simple framework is a poor approximation for the Milky Way.  The Galaxy evolves ``inside out''---where star formation is higher towards the center and in the early universe \citep{bird+13}. Additionally, stars can migrate several kpc over their lifetimes, mixing together different chemical environments across the galaxy \citep{bird+12,sellwood+binney02}. For the rest of this paper, I focus on multizone models, which discretize the Galaxy into concentric annuli and allow stare to move between rings.  Specifically, I make use of the \citet{james+21} (hereaafter \JJ) model for the Milky Way, which runs using the publicaly available Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (\VICE\footnote{\VICE~is available at \url{https://github.com/giganano/VICE}}). This model is described extensively in \JJ~and consicely summarized  in \citet{james+22}. Here, I provide a prief overiview of the relevant model components.

In the model, the Galaxy is divided into 200 rings, each 100 pc wide. Each ring has a seperate stellar population and gas supply. Star formation ends beyond a radius $R=15.5$ kpc. I initially assume an ``inside-out'' Star Formation History (SFH), where the star formation surface density $\Sigma_\star$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\Sigma}_\star \propto \left(1-e^{-t/\tau_{\rm rise}}\right) e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}.
\end{equation}
$\tau_\text{rise}=2$ Gyr describes when the star formation rate reaches a maximum, and $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ describes the decay timescale of star formation as a function of radius $R$. \JJ~derives $\tau_{\rm sfh}(R)$ through analysis of four integral field spectroscopy surveys in \cite{sanches20}.
The gas inflow is calculated to maintain our chosen SFR for each radius and time. The gas-SFR law is based on an extension of a Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{kennicutt98}, motivated by 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\Sigma}_{\star} \propto \\
\begin{cases}
    {\Sigma}_{\rm gas} & 2\times 10^7 \leq \Sigma_{\rm gas} \\ 
    {(\Sigma}_{\rm gas})^{3.6} & 5\times 10^6 \leq \Sigma_{\rm gas} < 2\times10^7 \\ 
    {(\Sigma}_{\rm gas})^{1.7} & \Sigma_{\rm gas} < 5\times10^6 \\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The star formation history is normalized such that the total stellar mass reaches $M_\star=5.17\times10^{10} {\rm M}_\odot$ \citep{LM15} and at each $R$ to match the stellar surface density gradient \citep{BHG16}.
$\tau_\star$ also varies with time due to the redshift dependence of $\tau_\star$ in molecular gas observed by \citet{tacconi18}.
I assume a Kroupa IMF \cite{kroupa01}.


\JJ\ accounts for radial migration by using the results of the \texttt{h277} hydrodynamical simulation \citep{christensen12, zolotov12, loebman12, BZ14}, with simulation parameters described in \citet{bird+21}. Each VICE single stellar population (SSP) is matched to an \textit{analogue} in \texttt{H277}, chosen to form at a similar time and radius $R$. By taking the change in radius $\Delta R$ of the analogues, the SSP move to their final radii with a $\sqrt{\text{time}}$ dependence.
This relationship between displacement and time arises when migration proceeds as a consequence of the diffusion of angular momentum \citep{frankel18, frankel20}.
I do not account for radial gas flows.
Using the results of a hydrodynamical simulation without modification limits the free parameters in the model; however, I are limitied to one dynamical history. The impact of the details of a galaxy's dynamical history on its chemical evolution is unknown, and I do not explore this question here.

As the strength of outflows controls the resulting $\alpha$ abundances, \JJ~create a metallicity gradienty by defining
\begin{equation}
\eta(R) = \frac{y_{\alpha}^{\rm CC}}{Z_{\alpha, \odot}} 10^{(-0.08\text{ kpc}^{-1})(R-4\text{ kpc})+0.3} + r - 1.
\end{equation}
This choice of $\eta(R)$ results in a [$\alpha$/H] gradient consistant with Milky Way observations \citep{james+21}.

I could chose to vary the value of $\alpha$; however, the overall scaling of
yields is unknown so our constraint is really that $Y_{\rm C}/Y_{\rm O} =
0.dfsjkhld$, based on binning from our data. As discussed in the previous
section, I chose to leave the total value of the IMF integrated yield fixed,
and then assert the AGB fraction (next section) and scale the AGB yields from
literature appropriety. As such, 

I explore uniformly scaling yields and outflows in Section REF. While I can constrain relative yields, the absolute scaling of yields and outflows is unknown and chemical evolution models are insensitive to this overal scalling \citep[e.g.][]{james_dwarf}.


\chapter{Multizone model results}
\section{Data Selection}

I use data from APOGEE DR17 \citep{apogee17} processed with APOSCAP. Since subgiant stars have yet to experience FDU, their atmospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances are still reflective of their birth abundances and do not need mixing corrections. 

To select for subgiants, I use the following cut in $\log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}$
which selects stars at the base of the red giant turnoff (FIGURE and
\cite{jack_subgiant}). I describe our selection criteria along with a 
comparison to \citet{fiorenzo+21} in Appendix \ref{sec:jack}. 

The inside-out star formation model fails
Because the star formation history is left in a simple inside-out form, this multizone model does not reproduce the high-$\alpha$ sequence, therefore I make the following cut to the V21 data to remove the high alpha sequence.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:high_alpha}
\begin{cases}
\text{[Mg/Fe]} >0.12-0.13\text{[Fe/H]}, & \text{[Fe/H]}<0\\
\text{[Mg/Fe]} >0.12, & \text{[Fe/H]}>0\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}




\section{The Evolution of carbon across the galaxy and through time}


Here, I present the time evolution of our fiducial model. In the next sections, I will discuss the choice of parameters and agreement with observations. Our fiducial model uses the C11 AGB yield set (see section \ref{sec:agb}). I amplify the C11 yields by a factor of 2.9, so that $\Ycagb = 0.2y_{\rm C}$, agb

In this model, I use the following yields:

The GCE of carbon is complicated by metallicity dependencies and delayed contributions. 

Note the following features of our model:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Carbon comes predominantly ($\sim80\%$) from CCSNe but the rest is from AGB stars
    \item The CCSNe carbon production is more efficient at higher metallicities
    \item AGB stars produce less carbon at higher metallicities.
\end{enumerate}


The combination of these features leads to an evolution that proceeds as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initially, CCSNe dominate production before AGB stars can contribute their enrichment, but because CCSNe is highly metalliticy dependent, the C/$\alpha$ ratio increases with time.
    \item AGB stars begin contributing their carbon, increasing the $C/\alpha$ ratio more steeply as the gas begins to reach its equilibrium metallicity
    \item When $Z$ reaches equilibrium, the $C/\alpha$ ratio stops increasing or may even decline, as AGB stars formed at higher metallicities reduce the net carbon yields.
\end{enumerate}

I plot time evolution tracks in Fig. \ref{fig:c_evo} for \caah and \caafe for our fiducial model. Comparing [C/$\alpha$] against [Fe/H] enables us to see late time evolution of carbon more clearly. Because [Fe/H] takes longer to reach equilibrium as half of iron production comes from type-Ia supernovae, the late time evolution is not clustered as tightly horizontally as for [$\alpha$/H].
This is even more evident in the lower part of Fig. \ref{fig:c_evo}. While the \caah trend reaches almost equilibrium at 5Gyr, the \caafe trend continues to evolve even until the present day, exposing the effect of the delayed contribution from AGB stars on the evolutionary history.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe definition of $f$ /etc.
    \item How I match the figures, DTD vs $\zeta$

\end{itemize}

\section{Alternate Models}

What happens as I change our choice of AGB stellar yields? I consider four models
using the published yields in \cristallo, \karakas, \kl, and \ventura~in Fig.
\ref{fig:agb_sims}. 


As the highest AGB yield at solar is from our \karakas~model at $Y_{\rm C}^{\rm
agb} = 0.000585$ is only 11.7 percent of our required total carbon production,
each of these models is dominated by CC production of carbon. As a result,
while the metallicity dependence of the \caah may vary, the
\caafe diagnostic shows how this small AGB fraction makes the details of
the AGB model and delay-time-distribution unchange the galaxy production of
carbon. 

Appendix \ref{sec:alt_agb} describes the effects of increasing the AGB model on
resulting abundance trends. However, I use the \cristallo AGB yields for the
rest of the main discussion.

Our next exploration is to adjust the relative fraction of AGB star yields. To do this, I hold the total carbon yield at solar metallicity fixed, so for a desired AGB fraction (assuming equilibrium), 


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{oob_agb.pdf}
\caption[AGB GCE Models]{

Colored lines quantify the median [C/Mg] in bins of [Mg/H] for our four AGB yield models from the literature (see \ref{sec:agb}). Black points and grey dashes represent the median and standard deviations in the \citet{jack_subgiant} sample. In the right panel, I show the trends only for stars where $-0.15\leq {\rm [Mg/H]}\leq -0.05$.
}
\label{fig:agb_sims}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}\label{fig:beta_f}
\centering
\includegraphics{beta.pdf}
\includegraphics{f_agb.pdf}

\caption[Adjusted yield models]{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:agb_sims} except the top plot shows the fiducial model with lower and higher values of $\zeta$, the C-CCSNe metallicity dependence. The bottom plot shows models with $f_{\rm AGB}=$0.1, 0.2, and 0.4. Both the $f_{\rm AGB}$ and $\zeta$ influence \caah, but only $f_{\rm AGB}$ has a significant impact on \caafe.}
\end{figure}

The next question is how does changing the CCSNe carbon yield affect the model?
I now consider variations of our fiducial mode/


As I display in Fig. \ref{fig:beta_f}, I observe that changes in $\beta$ are
approprietly reflected in the resulting \caah~trend. As the metallicity
dependence steepens with higher $\beta$, the [C/Mg] ratio becomes
correspondingly more dependent on [Mg/H].

Carbon as an equilibrium phenominon. See section \ref{sec:equilibrium} Importantly, the \caafe trend is mostly unaffected by choosing a different
CCSNe yield. As all CCSNe enrichment happens at the same, rapid timescale, by
taking a slice in [Mg/H], this metallicity dependence is effectively ignored as
the only effect can be a vertical offset if the slice is narrow enough. 

So, the scaling of the trend and metallicity dependence of carbon (as seen in
the \caah~trend) gives information on the total carbon yield and the behavior
of CCSNe (as the dominating producer of carbon);
the \caafe trend exposes the delayed effect of carbon from AGB contribution.

One caveat is that the slope of this trend is also determined by the ratio of delayed iron to CCSNe iron production as well. If the SNeIa iron fraction is increased, then more iron enters later reducing the slope of the trend as AGB becomes a more rapid mechanism than Fe comparatively. The difference however is that changing the Fe franction mostly affects the tail of the distribution as this controls the speed of descent off the high $\alpha$ sequence, but the AGB fraction even changes the behavior for the low $\alpha$ sequence.

One potential tension with data is our models predict a low value for the AGB fraction of stars. 

Our model with Z-dependent CCSNe yields has $f_\text{agb} = 0.05$ which implies that CCSNe overwhelms AGB production and there should not be a seperation between low and high alpha sequences. However, V21 observes a significant seperation implying a more substantial delayed-time source. 

Even changing the AGB model does not affect the conclusion significantly. 

An alternate solution is to reduce the outflows and core collapse yields similarly, consistent with a model where more large stars collapse directly into black holes. This leaves the $y_\text{C}^\text{CC}/y_\text{O}^\text{CC}$ ratio unchanged, but because $y_\text{C}^\text{CC}$ is unchanged, the relative size of the AGB contribution is larger. 


Increasing the relative AGB production lowers the magnitude of  $y_\text{C}^\text{CC}/y_\text{O}^\text{CC}$, but the metallicity dependence of the ratio must increase to compensate for the inverse metallicity dependence of AGB carbon yields. 

These models are indistinguishable in the \caah~plane from our adjusted CCSNe model, so future work investigating the SFH and carbon isotopic ratios in more depth may be able to provide more insight. In the next section, I develop the analytic tools to explore this problem in more depth. 

\section{Star Formation History} \label{sec:sfh}



\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{lateburst_eta.pdf}

\caption[Lateburst models]{Same as Figure \ref{fig:agb_sims} but comparing the fiducial model to alternate star formation histories (see \S \ref{sec:sfh}).}
\label{fig:sfh_models}

\end{figure}


Here, I consider a "lateburst" model, created by multiplying our fiducial "inside-out" SFH with a gaussian.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lateburst}
    \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm lateburst} \propto \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm insideout} \left(1 + A e^{-(t-\tau_{\rm burst})^2/2\sigma^2_{\rm burst}} \right)
\end{equation}

$A=1.5$ represents the amplitude of the birth, $\tau_\text{burst}=10.8$Gyr is the time where the burst is strongest, and $\sigma_\text{burst}=1$Gyr is the width of the burst.

I also consider a 2-infall model as a slight variation of the lateburst, where the burst is instead exponential and placed at $t_1=5$ Gyr. This approximantly corresponsed to the Gaia-Encelidus merger, inducing higher star formation in the Milky Way \citep{bonaca20, helmi18}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twoinfall}
    \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm 2-infall} \propto \dot{\Sigma}_{\rm insideout} + 
\begin{cases}
    Ae^{-(t-t_1)/\tau_{\rm burst}} & t_1 < t \\
      0 & t<t_1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where I take the burst duration, $\tau_{\rm burst}=1$ Gyr in this case. 
This more drastic burst is able to more successfuly populate the high-$\alpha$ sequence. I leave more detailed exploration of the effects of star formation histories to future work.

I show these variations on the star formation history in figure \ref{fig:sfh_models}.


\section{Outflows} \label{sec:outflows}

A common degeneracy in chemical evolution models is the yield-outflow degeneracy. An increase in stellar yields has a near-identical effect as a decrease in outflows. For example, the equilibrium abundance ratios are entirely independent of $\eta$ (see section \ref{sec:equilibrium}). My model is able to determine yield ratios well, but is unable to differentiate differences in the overall scaling of outflows and yields.

While my model requires high yields and significant mass loading, other approaches neglect outflows altogether \citep{MCM13, MCM14, spitoni19, spitoni20, spitoni21}. By modifying our model such that $\eta=0$, I can create outflow-less models.


The theoretical motivation for decreasing outflows is due to the uncertainty in the explodability landscape---if less massive stars explode, then both the yields and outflows will be reduced by some factor. So, when I explore reduced outflow models, I consider models where both the outflows and yields are reduced by approximately the same factor, to leave the equilibrium abundances of a pure CCSNe unchanged. 

The effect of reducing outflows is then increasing the relative contributions of non-CCSNe processes. For carbon, this increases the AGB fraction.

I find that the \caah~relationship may provide insight into this issue. [O/Fe] is a tracer of the relative contributions of CCSNe and delayed-time sources in chemical evolution. So, the appearance of a slope in [O/Fe] implies that there is a substantial delay-time process in carbon evolution. 
The metallicity-dependence of carbon yields complicates this picture because
younger stars have higher [O/Fe] as the SNeIa contributions take up to 10Gyr,
so metal-poor young stars will naturally have lower [C/O], agreeing with the
slope observed in\caafe. However, a pure CCSNe carbon model cannot reproduce the slope accurately as  


I find that I can adjust both the outflows and scale down the yields if I change our model for $y_\text{C}^\text{CC}/y_\text{O}^\text{CC}$. For example, reducing outflows and CCSNe yields by a factor of two requires the modified parameters
$\alpha = 0.033$ and $\beta = 0.625$, which results in a slightly lower value at solar but nearly a doubling of the metallicity dependence.

\includegraphics{eta.pdf}

\caption[Reduced-outflow models]{Same as Figure \ref{fig:agb_sims} but comparing the fiducial model to reduced outflow models (see \S \ref{sec:outflows}).}
\end{figure}


\section{Comparison to Observations}


Beyond simply comparing median trends, I can compare the distribution 
shape of our distribution to observations. 

Carbon measurments in stars are difficult. There are measurments which can however be used to test. 

I don't predict low metallicity but I are in agreement, substantial error bars.

Pop III stars from Cooke++. 

Beyond Milky Way stars, astronomers have observed carbon to oxygen ratios in
HII-regions through either Recombination Lines or (OTHER TEchnique0), enabling
us to probe gas-phase abundances of carbon in our galaxy and other types of
galaxies from dwarf to elliptical. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:gas_phase}, I plot our fiducial model's gas phase abundances
at present day and 2Gyr compared to C/O
abundances measured in both stars, our subgiant sample, halo stars, galaxies,
and even Damped Lynman Alpha (DLA) systems. 

Our model appears to be broadly consistant with the gas phase data, however these imply if anything that the slope should be increased. 

Are HII regions a good approximation?

Measuring carbon in the gas phase is challenging. Carbon emission lines are
very weak compared to other common lines, (visible/etc.).
Temperature/modelining limitations. Lack of strong HII calibration. 

Short discussion of measurment challenges in extragalactic galaxies, how other galaxies and dwarf SFH may come into play, why this relation is notecably steeper.

Our model fails to capture the trend past [$\alpha$/H]$=-1$. As our knowledge
of stellar evolution is limited, our knowledge of extremely metal poor stellar
evolution is extremely limited. (despite a pure H/He born star appearing
simpler lolol). A variety of explanation for the increasing relative carbon
enrichments for metal-poor stars have been proposed (e.g. ...). The likely case
that Population III star supernovae produced high abundances of carbon seems
most plausable, especially given our uncertainty in the carbon yields and the
short timescales required to create this enhancement (e.g. $z\sim 2$ DLA,
dwarfs, etc.) make it unlikely that AGB stars could be the culprit. 

As any constraints in this regieme are poor, I choose to only qualitatively
conclude that CCSNe carbon production increases at extremely low metallicity
but the details of this remains an open question.


Can I use our yield estimations and apply them to extragalactic sources successfully? 

Explain Berg+19,

Bursty SFH may not be needed to explain scatter as the C/O slope + differet evolutionary timescales is capable alone of reproducing this scatter.

While the extragalactic trend appears to be more steeply sloped than our models, this is because of ***e.g. mass-dependent outflow rates/differening SFH between galaxies.

\chapter{Conclusions}

In this work, I investigate the role of carbon yields on the predictions of multizone GCE models. \citet{james+22} performed a similar analysis, except focusing on nitrogen. \citet{james+22} found, to match APOGEE/\citet{fiorenzo+21}'s observations, nitrogen yields ratios relative to oxygen needed to be about triple what AGB models suggested.

Here, I perform a similar analysis on carbon. I summarize the current theoretical nucleosynthetic predictions of carbon. Because CCSNe carbon yields are poorly understood, I adopt an equilibrium approximation and determine that a functional form of $\Ycc/\Yoc=1.51 + 0.54 (Z/Z_\odot)$ approximately matches trends in APOGEE subgiants. Variations of the metallicity dependence of this CCSNe yield affect trends in \caah but do not affect trends in \caafe when taking a slice in [Mg/H]. As all theoretical AGB carbon yields decrease with increasing metallicity, increasing the AGB fraction causes the \caah trend to flatten. However, the \caafe trend is sensitive to the AGB fraction. 
I estimate that $f_{\rm AGB} = 0.2$ using the C11 yield model. This requires about 3x more AGB carbon production than most nucleosynthetic models predict.

Evolutionary history

Finally, I compare my model against gas phase and metal-poor stellar measurments. While my model was built on data near solar metallicity, by including heightened carbon production from population III stars, I can create a self consistant picture of carbon evolution.

Implications in Stellar evolution

These carbon yield constraints provide a test for stellar evolution models. Carbon yields are sensitive to mass loss treatment, explodability, nuclear cross sections, convection, and stellar structure. 

Future surveys such as the Milky Way Mapper will enable further refinement of galactic trends, placing yet more stringent constrants on stellar evolution models.

\section{The APOGEE Subgiant Sample}\label{sec:jack}

I use the criteria outlined in \cite{jack_subgiant} to create a sample of subgiants from APOGEE DR17 \cite{apogee17} as our primary observational constraint. 
\cite{jack_subgiant} selects a region of stars in $\log g$-$T_\text{eff}$ space described by the following polyhedron
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases} \label{eq:subgiant_selection}
        \log \text{g} \geq 3.5 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq 0.004T_{\rm eff} - 15.7 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq 0.000706T_{\rm eff} + 0.36 \\
        \log \text{g} \leq -0.0015T_{\rm eff} + 12.05 \\
        \log \text{g} \geq 0.0012T_{\rm eff} - 2.8 \\

These stars have not yet experienced first dredge-up, so their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances should reflect their birth mixture.

This cut isolates a clean sample of subgiants. As First Dredge Up, which affects carbon and nitrogen abundances, only occurs during the ascent onto the red giant branch, subgiant stars are unaffected by this enrichment. 

Additionally, I exclued stars in APOGEE marked by the following flags.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|APOGEE_MIRCLUSTER_STAR|
\item \verb|APOGEE_EMISSION_STAR|
\item \verb|APOGEE_EMBEDDEDCLUSTER_STAR|
\item \verb|young cluster (IN-SYNC)|
\item \verb|APOGEE2_W345|
\item \verb|EB planet|
\end{itemize}

A second approach in determining birth abundances in stars is to correct the surface abundance effects of FDU, as in \cite{fiorenzo+21}. I note that there is a slight difference in the yields found through \cite{fiorenzo+21} and \cite{jack_subgiant}. As o

I choose to use \cite{jack_subgiant}'s sample as this does not rely on additional layers of modeling, providing a more direct constraint to our model and limiting our systematic uncertainties.

\section{Additional Considerations of Yields}\label{sec:alt_agb}


While I focus the main discussion of the paper on the C11 model, other AGB models can have notable effects on abundance trends at ***

Because the predictions of the AGB yield models I consider are dwarfed by the
required CCSNe carbon production to match observations (see Fig. ***), I briefly explore here the effects of variations in AGB models affect abundance trend predictions when these models are amplified to match observational [C/MG]-[Mg/Fe] trends. 

While most models are well represented by our AGB-fraction formalism, V13 presents a challenge as the predicted solar yield is much lower than the lower metallicity predictions, requiring the solar value to be a certain fraction forces us to amplify the yields by an unreasonable about (of order 10-30times) to reach the same $f_{\rm AGB}$ as other models. Thus, I instead calculate $f_{\rm AGB}$ at a metallicity of ... for this model. 

V13 is also interesting as at high metallicity, the yields quickly become strongly negative. This causes a reversal of the [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend at high [Mg/H] slices (figure ...). As our set of observations do not appear to reverse, this indicates that carbon yields likely stay positive even at slightly super-solar, so models like V13 are a poor match to observations.
